# setup sqlite3 if installed
#
# sqlite is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because macOS provides an older sqlite3.
#
# If you need to have sqlite first in your PATH run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
# For compilers to find sqlite you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib"
#   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include"
#
# For pkg-config to find sqlite you may need to set:
#   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib/pkgconfig"
