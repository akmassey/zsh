# Aaron Massey's zsh configuration

This is a bit of a mess right now, but I wanted to manage my zsh configuration
in a separate repository, so I'm dumping it here now.  Feel free to steal a
few things from it.  I know I've stolen a lot of tips from other places, many
of which I don't use often enough to justify keeping in here.

Please note that this configuration requires [oh-my-zsh][1], and I'm not
managing it here.
